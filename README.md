## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-clone-url>
cd nlp-conversational-ai
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk seaborn missingno plotly
```

### 3. Download Datasets

Some notebooks expect datasets in specific paths (e.g., `C:/Machine Learning/ML_Datasets/`). Update the paths in the notebooks or place the datasets accordingly.

### 4. Run the Notebooks

Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and start exploring!
