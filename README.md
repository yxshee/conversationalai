## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-conversational-ai.git
cd nlp-conversational-ai
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Most notebooks require Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:

![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-013243?logo=numpy)
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-150458?logo=pandas)
![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-11557c?logo=matplotlib)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-f7931e?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)
![NLTK](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NLTK-9C27B0?logo=nltk)
![Seaborn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Seaborn-43b02a?logo=seaborn)
![Missingno](https://img.shields.io/badge/-missingno-00bcd4)
![Plotly](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Plotly-3f4f75?logo=plotly)

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk seaborn missingno plotly
```

### 3. Download Datasets

Some notebooks expect datasets in specific paths (e.g., `C:/Machine Learning/ML_Datasets/`). Update the paths in the notebooks or place the datasets accordingly.

### 4. Run the Notebooks

Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and start exploring!
