## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-conversational-ai.git
cd nlp-conversational-ai
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Most notebooks require Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- seaborn
- missingno
- plotly

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk seaborn missingno plotly
```

### 3. Download Datasets

Some notebooks expect datasets in specific paths (e.g., `C:/Machine Learning/ML_Datasets/`). Update the paths in the notebooks or place the datasets accordingly.

### 4. Run the Notebooks

Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and start exploring!

## Visual Guide

### Example: NumPy Array Creation

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(10)
print(a)
```

### Example: Text Preprocessing Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Text Corpus] --> B[Normalization]
    B --> C[Tokenization]
    C --> D[Stopword Removal]
    D --> E[Stemming/Lemmatization]
    E --> F[Feature Matrix]
```

## Learning Path

1. **NumPy & Pandas:** Start with the basics of numerical and tabular data manipulation.
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Learn how to clean and prepare text data for NLP tasks.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Explore methods to convert text into numerical features (TDM, TF-IDF, etc.).
4. **Modeling:** Apply machine learning models for classification, regression, and conversational AI.
5. **Advanced Topics:** Outlier analysis, feature selection, and more.
